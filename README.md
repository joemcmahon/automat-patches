# Automat patches

Created through Automat's great patch randomizer, with minor tweaks.

## Aliens in the Pipes:
 - Semi-vocal, noisy ascending tone into a long reverb. Most effective
   from below C3 or so. Perfect for that "something awful down that metal
   corridor" effect.

## Attack Drum:
 - Short notes have an enveloped noise burst with a random chirp layered in;
   hold and you get a looping metallic tone plus a panning rhythmic loop.

## Attitude Burn:
 - Hold for best effect. Resonant noise with long attack and decay.

## Bowed Hullmetal:
 - Slow attack and decay, rather like a 70's organ in the low octaves, and
   more metallic at higher pitches.

## Clockwork Comet:
 - Falling gated pitch overlaid with drumlike sound. Slow attack and decay.

## Excessive Subtlety
 - Slow attack with gated filter. Quieter than most patches.

## Extra-sustain Pad
 - Gentle attack to an insects-and-metal texture that never cuts off.

## Filtered Trickle
 - Slow attack to a fast-panning chirpy gated tone. Near-instant cutoff on
   key up.

## Flyby
 - Fades in an alternating sustained tone; relatively short cutoff.

## Hydroponics Tank
 - Loopy and gloopy, moderate attack and decay. Sometimes sends something into
    uncontrolled nasty oscillation if played hard and rapidly. Be ready to mute!

## Imitation Shortwave
 - Best at low frequencies: a gliding, looping resonant sound. Quick cutoff.

## Incoherent Invaders
 - Metallic looping and sliding vocal tone. Best at higher pitches.

## Iron Drone
 - Bitonal, loops fading in and out at different rates. 45 second decay.

## It's in the Exhaust
 - LOUD metallic tremolo with a long decay.

## Mad Pad
 - Faint, randomly panning gated and modulated tone. Medium decay.

## Melody knock
 - Shimmery lead with a two-tone percussive loop.

## Metallic Hover
 - Long attack to panning sustain; multiple desynced loops.

## Nothing on Scanners
 - Rumbly tone with heavily panned upward sweeps overlaid.

## Pipe Rhythm
 - Hard attack into resonant tone; if held, envelope loops and the whole tone
   phases. Short decay.

## Radar Ping
 - Metallic loop fades in and out; very shortwave.

## Release Bell
 - Bell tone that plays only after you hold the key a couple seconds then
   release it.

## Sentient Cereal
 - Hold multiple keys, struck at different times, for best effect. A crackly
   filtered tone slides up and down until you release the key.

## Shiver bell
 - Quick attack, with a long modulating decay; semi-flute tone.

## Shortwave dogs
 - Sweeping woofy tone into heavy reverb; an additional high tone may send 
   the effects into a loop giving a super-long-sustain.

## Shortwave Harmonia
 - FM texture, with a different pair of intervals om each key.

## Slight Short
 - Quiet lead tone with an electric drone behind it.

## Spaaace Ghooost
 - Pair of warbling tones; slow attack and decay even if held.

## Space Cicada
 - Metallic insect-like drones fade in and out.

## Spaceship Ambience I
 - Rapidly-modulated tones fade in and out; a quick release will briefly
   sustain the base note.

## Spaceship Ambience II
 - Drony, metallic, deep reverb.

## Spaceship Ambience III
 - Sustained tone with pink noise behind.

## Spaceship Ambience IV
 - Rhythmically-modulated pink noise.

## Subtle Yawp
 - Tone 1 slides rapidly down and up; tone 2 modulates at audio frequency then
   fades.

## Tiny Wavicle
 - Narrowly-filtered pure tone is slowly amplitude modulated.

## Tremelo Bottle
 - A paired lead tone with a slight bit of crunch.

## Uncontrolled Tumble
 - Crunchy noise with strong modulated filtering.

## Warp Transit
 - Filtered noise plus a looping crunchy tone. Leaves a quiet, slowly AM-
   modulated tone that continues to sustain after key-up. May go into feedback
   if left unattended.

## What Was That
 - Burbling, crunching thing fades in then back out. Creepy low in a mix.
